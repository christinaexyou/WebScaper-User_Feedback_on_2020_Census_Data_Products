# WebScaper-User_Feedback_on_2020_Census_Data_Products

A webscaper that scrapes the [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/USBC-2018-0009/comments?pageNumber=1) website for user feedback on 2020 Census Data Products where the bureau implemented its TopDown algorithm for the first time after it concluded traditional disclosure avoidance mechanisms were insufficient to protect census participants' privacy.

Webscraping is documented comments_scraper.py. It iterates through each page of the website and downloads users' comments into a specified directory on your local machine.
